      <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>There are many ways of working out, some of the ways are more effective than others. On this website you will learn how I recommend setting up workouts and routines. The first question that you need to ask yourself is, "What am I trying to achieve?" This question will help guide you to picking your preferred style of exercising.</p>
    <h2>Workout Styles</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Body weight exercises are great for getting stronger but not bigger. Think lean, mean, fighting machine!</li>
    <li>Weighted exercises are best for gaining lots of muscle and surprisingly enough, weight loss! Stop the treadmills and elipticals because those won't get you results as effectively as weight lifting!</li>
    <li>If your goal is to getting stronger and larger than I recommend doing a bit of both, this is my preferred way of working out. You won't necessarily excell in one way or another but there will be a lot of exercises that you'll be able to do/be comfortable with!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <p>As far as my recommendation for reps, sets and or time spent exercising, I will give some suggestions here but I will not tell you what to do because at the end of the day, you know your body better than I do!</p>
    <ul>
    <li>My suggestion for sets will be 1-3 per exercise (3 if you are in decent shape or taking it easy). Keep the sets no longer than 1 minute apart, this will help with building more strength.</li> 
    <li>Reps will be up to you once again but I'd stick to about 3-5 if you are trying to build more muscle (size) and 10-15 if you are looking to get stronger but not necessarily bigger (you'll gain more muscle but not the same amount you will if you use fewer reps).</li>
    <li>And of course you may choose to go with timed exercises instead of reps. This can be effective if you are trying to go for quality over quantity. And depending on your level you may want to do each exercise for about 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li> 
    <li>Another suggestion, keep muscle groups that work together in the same workouts, E.G. chest and triceps should be done on the same day.</li> 
    <li>This is helpful if you wish to workout multiple days in a row because if you do what are called "Bro Splits" you don't give your muscle the time required to recover properly from the exercises.</li> 
    <li>If you wish to do total body workouts make sure you take a day off in between to let your muscles recover, though you don't need to worry about you shoulders, legs or abs, those muscles tend to get used every day so those muscles can handle being worked every day.</li> 
    </ul>
